# Simple Weather App

## Overview
This is a minimalist Weather App that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates. The project focuses on mastering fundamental concepts of asynchronous JavaScript, including Promises, Callbacks, Async/await, Fetch() API, Promise.all(), Promise.any(), Async and Await, JSON(), and Web Workers.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates:** Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **User Location Detection:** Allows users to detect their current location for weather updates.
- **Weather Forecasts:** Provides forecasts for better user planning.
- **Clean and Minimalist Design:** A simple and user-friendly interface with a focus on readability.

## Technologies Used
